## Analysis Framework

When analyzing any business situation, follow this structured approach:

### STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION

**Gather Information:**
- What industry/market is this?
- Who are the key players (competitors, suppliers, buyers)?
- What is the product/service?
- What is the business question or decision to be made?

### STEP 2: EXTERNAL ANALYSIS

**A. Industry Attractiveness (Porter's 5 Forces)**

| Force | Assessment | Evidence |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Threat of New Entrants | High/Med/Low | |
| Supplier Power | High/Med/Low | |
| Buyer Power | High/Med/Low | |
| Threat of Substitutes | High/Med/Low | |
| Industry Rivalry | High/Med/Low | |

**B. Identify Opportunities & Threats (SWOT External)**
- Market trends
- Competitive dynamics
- Economic factors
- Regulatory environment

### STEP 3: MARKET STRUCTURE ANALYSIS (SCP Framework)

**Identify the Market Structure:**

| Characteristic | Perfect Competition | Monopolistic Competition | Oligopoly | Monopoly |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Number of Firms | Very large | Many | Few | One |
| Product Type | Standardized | Differentiated | Either | Unique |
| Entry Barriers | None | Low | High | Blocked |
| Price Control | None (price taker) | Some | Limited/Collusive | Considerable |

**Key Questions:**
- How many competitors? → Determines structure
- Is product differentiated? → Affects pricing power
- How hard to enter? → Determines long-run profits
- What is the C4/HHI concentration? → C4 ≥ 40% = Oligopoly

**Structure Determines Conduct:**
| Structure | Optimal Pricing Approach |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Perfect Competition | Accept market price, produce where P = MC |
| Monopolistic Competition | MR = MC, differentiate product |
| Oligopoly | Consider rivals (kinked demand, collusion, price leadership) |
| Monopoly | MR = MC, maximum price from demand curve |

### STEP 4: INTERNAL ANALYSIS

**A. Cost Structure Analysis**

| Cost Type | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Fixed Costs (FC) | | Rent, equipment, salaries |
| Variable Costs (VC) | | Materials, direct labor |
| Average Total Cost (ATC) | TC/Q | |
| Marginal Cost (MC) | ΔTC/ΔQ | |

**Key Questions:**
- What are the main cost drivers?
- Are there economies of scale? (ATC falls with Q)
- What is the minimum efficient scale (MES)?
- Should we outsource or vertically integrate?

**B. Identify Strengths & Weaknesses (SWOT Internal)**
- Resources and capabilities
- Cost position vs competitors
- Brand and market position
- Operational efficiency

### STEP 5: STRATEGIC OPTIONS

**A. Pricing Strategy Options**

| Strategy | When to Use | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Uniform Pricing | Simple, one price | MR = MC, then find P from demand |
| Price Discrimination | Can segment markets | Different prices for different groups |
| Two-Part Tariff | Recurring purchases | Lump sum fee + per-unit price |
| Bundling | Complementary products | Package products together |

**B. Non-Price Competition**
- Product differentiation (STP: Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning)
- Branding and advertising
- Innovation and R&D
- Quality improvements

### STEP 6: FINANCIAL EVALUATION

**Key Metrics to Calculate:**

```
Break-Even Quantity = FC / (P - AVC)
Profit = (P - ATC) × Q
ROI = Net Profit / Investment × 100%
NPV = Σ [CF_t / (1+r)^t] - Initial Investment
```

**Decision Rules:**
| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Continue operating? | Continue if P > AVC |
| Invest in project? | Accept if NPV > 0 or ROI > cost of capital |
| Optimal output? | Produce where MR = MC |
| Profitable? | Profit if P > ATC |

### STEP 7: STRATEGIC FIT (BCG Matrix)

**For Portfolio Decisions:**

| Category | Market Share | Growth | Strategy |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Star | High | High | Invest heavily |
| Question Mark | Low | High | Evaluate carefully |
| Cash Cow | High | Low | Milk for cash |
| Dog | Low | Low | Divest or reposition |

### STEP 8: RECOMMENDATION

**Structure the recommendation as:**

1. **RECOMMENDATION**: Clear statement of what to do
2. **RATIONALE**: Top 3 reasons with evidence
3. **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Financial and strategic results
4. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Key action steps
5. **RISKS**: Main risks and mitigation

## Key Formulas Reference

### Profit Maximization
```
All structures: Produce where MR = MC (MC rising)
Perfect Competition: P = MR = MC
Others: Find Q from MR = MC, then P from demand curve
```

### Shutdown Decision
```
Continue if: P > AVC (or P > min AVC)
Shutdown if: P < AVC
```

### Break-Even
```
Q_BE = FC / (P - AVC)
```

### Market Concentration
```
HHI = Σ (Market Share %)²
C4 = Top 4 firms' combined market share
Oligopoly rule: C4 ≥ 40%
```

### Elasticity & Pricing
```
Ed = (% ΔQ) / (% ΔP)
Elastic (|Ed| > 1): Lower price → Higher revenue
Inelastic (|Ed| < 1): Raise price → Higher revenue
```

### Long-Run Equilibrium
```
Perfect Competition: P = MC = min ATC (zero profit)
Monopolistic Competition: P = ATC > MC = MR (zero profit)
Oligopoly/Monopoly: P > ATC possible (positive profit)
```
