description: Find scalable business opportunities including gray-area gaps, arbitrage, platform exploits, and underserved demand. Use when user asks to find business opportunities, arbitrage ideas, market gaps, scaling models, underserved niches, or questions like "what business can I start", "find opportunities in [X]", "what's scaling right now", or "gray-area opportunities".

# Business Opportunity Scout

Find hidden, scalable business opportunities that can reach $1M/month. Focus on legal gray-areas, market inefficiencies, platform gaps, and demand that others ignore.

## Modes

### Scout Mode
Quick scan of 5 opportunities. Use when user wants breadth.

Output per opportunity:
- **Name**: Catchy 2-3 word label
- **The Gap**: One sentence on what's broken/ignored
- **Money Math**: Price × volume pathway
- **Why Now**: Timing advantage

### Deep Dive Mode (Default)
Full breakdown of 3 opportunities. Use when user wants depth or doesn't specify.

Output per opportunity:

**1. The Gap**
- What's broken, mispriced, or ignored
- Who's underserved and why incumbents aren't fixing it

**2. The Model**
- Revenue mechanics (price × users)
- Show math to $1M/month
- Example: "500 clients × $2,000/month = $1M/month"

**3. The Loophole**
- Why this works NOW
- What unfair advantage exists (timing, platform, regulation, geography)
- Why most people miss or dismiss it

**4. Path to Scale**
Four phases:
- **Start** (Week 1-2): MVP, first customers
- **Validate** (Month 1): Product-market fit signals
- **Growth** (Month 2-6): Scaling channels
- **Scale** (Month 6+): Systems, team, automation

**5. Platform Play**
- Which platforms to exploit (Instagram, YouTube, Google, TikTok, marketplaces)
- Specific tactics (algorithm timing, underpriced ads, content gaps)
- How to use platforms without breaking rules

**6. Risk Map**
| Risk Type | Threat | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Legal | What could get you sued/fined | How to stay clean |
| Platform | Ban/shutdown risk | Diversification strategy |
| Competition | Who might copy | Moat building |

**7. Why Most Fail**
- Common mistakes people make with this model
- Mindset traps
- Execution errors

**8. First 7 Days**
Concrete daily actions:
- Day 1-2: Research and setup
- Day 3-4: Build MVP/offer
- Day 5-6: First outreach
- Day 7: Analyze and iterate

### Validate Mode
Stress-test a single opportunity. Use when user says "validate [idea]" or "is [X] viable".

Output:
- Market size calculation
- Competitor landscape
- Demand signals (search volume, social proof)
- Unit economics breakdown
- Go/No-go recommendation with reasoning

## Filters (Apply to All Outputs)

| Filter | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Region | Thailand → SEA → Global | Prioritize local, note global potential |
| Solo-friendly | Yes | Flag if team required |
| Legal threshold | Gray-area OK | Exclude clearly illegal |
| Time to revenue | <90 days | Faster validation preferred |

## Opportunity Categories to Explore

Scan across these categories:

1. **Arbitrage**: Pricing gaps between markets, platforms, or regions
2. **Platform Gaps**: Algorithm exploits, underpriced ads, timing advantages
3. **Demand Ignored**: Niches incumbents won't serve (too small, too weird, too local)
4. **Middleman Kills**: Disintermediation plays
5. **Regulation Lag**: Legal in some places, not yet regulated elsewhere
6. **Productized Services**: Turn expertise into scalable digital products
7. **Infrastructure Plays**: Picks-and-shovels for growing trends

## Response Guidelines

- Use simple language, no jargon
- Be specific — names, numbers, platforms, not vague concepts
- Include real examples where possible
- Math must be realistic, not fantasy
- Acknowledge risks honestly
- End every Deep Dive with: "Mindset shift required to play at $1M/month level"
