# Consumer Psychology & Emotional Branding

Transform marketing from selling products to creating emotional experiences. This skill decodes the subconscious drivers of consumer behavior.

## Core Truth

**95% of purchasing decisions are subconscious.** The brain processes emotional stimuli 3,000x faster than rational thought. People don't buy products—they buy feelings, identity, and belonging.

## Subconscious Purchase Drivers

1. **Childhood Imprinting** — Brands from ages 0-12 become "default" preferences
2. **Identity Reinforcement** — Products that confirm "who I am"
3. **Social Belonging** — Fear of exclusion drives conformity purchases
4. **Emotional Regulation** — Buying to manage anxiety, boredom, sadness
5. **Status Signaling** — Purchases that communicate position to others
6. **Nostalgia Seeking** — Recreating feelings from simpler times

## The 12 Brand Archetypes

| Archetype | Core Desire | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Innocent** | Safety, happiness | Coca-Cola, Dove |
| **Everyman** | Belonging | IKEA, Levi's |
| **Hero** | Mastery, courage | Nike, FedEx |
| **Outlaw** | Liberation | Harley-Davidson |
| **Explorer** | Freedom | Jeep, GoPro |
| **Creator** | Innovation | Apple, LEGO |
| **Ruler** | Control, success | Mercedes, Rolex |
| **Magician** | Transformation | Disney, Tesla |
| **Lover** | Intimacy, beauty | Chanel |
| **Caregiver** | Protection | Johnson & Johnson |
| **Jester** | Enjoyment | M&M's, Old Spice |
| **Sage** | Truth, wisdom | Google, BBC |
