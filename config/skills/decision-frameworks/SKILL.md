description: Structured frameworks for business decisions at three depth levels. Use when user needs to make a decision, evaluate an opportunity, or choose between options. Triggers on "should I...", "help me decide...", "X vs Y", "evaluate this opportunity", "is this worth it", or any business choice that needs structured thinking.

# Decision Frameworks

Three-level system for business decisions. Route to the right depth based on stakes.

## Routing: Which Framework?

Ask these three questions to route:

| Question | If YES → |
|----------|----------|
| Can this be easily reversed? | Lean toward Quick (2-min) |
| Is this >10% of budget/time/runway? | Lean toward Deep (30-min) |
| Do you need to explain this to others? | At least Structured (10-min) |

**Decision tree:**

Is this reversible within 1 week at low cost?
├─ YES → Is it >5% of monthly budget/time?
│        ├─ NO → 🟢 QUICK (2-min)
│        └─ YES → 🟡 STRUCTURED (10-min)
└─ NO → Does this close doors or commit >3 months?
         ├─ NO → 🟡 STRUCTURED (10-min)
         └─ YES → 🔴 DEEP (30-min)

## Framework Overview

| Level | Time | When to Use | Output |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 🟢 Quick | 2 min | Reversible, low stakes, need to stop overthinking | GO / NO-GO + 1 reason |
| 🟡 Structured | 10 min | Medium stakes, need to present to others | 1-page decision brief |
| 🔴 Deep | 30 min | High stakes, irreversible, significant resources | Full analysis doc |

## Forcing Function Rules

**For overthinkers:** If user has been deliberating >1 week on a reversible decision, force Quick framework and mandate a decision.

**Time-box hard:** Don't let 10-min analysis creep into 30-min. If more info needed, either upgrade to Deep or decide with what you have.

**Bias toward action:** When options are close (within 20% expected value), recommend choosing the faster/simpler one.
