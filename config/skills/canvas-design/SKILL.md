# Canvas Design

Create design philosophies expressed visually. Output .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.

## Two Steps
1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf or .png file)

## Philosophy Creation

Create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY interpreted through:
- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs):
- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance

## Canvas Creation

Create museum/magazine quality work using the design philosophy. Create one highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG.

**Guidelines:**
- Use repeating patterns and perfect shapes
- Sparse, clinical typography
- Limited color palette that feels intentional
- Text is always minimal and visual-first
- Nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless
- Every element must be contained within canvas boundaries

**Philosophy Examples:**
- "Concrete Poetry" - Massive color blocks, sculptural typography, Brutalist spatial divisions
- "Chromatic Language" - Geometric precision where color zones create meaning
- "Analog Meditation" - Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space
